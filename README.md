#Chubby
Adding some fat to [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim).

For more information, please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/a3gz/chubby/wiki).

## Install 

Via composer 

    require a3gz/chubby 
    
**Note**   
*This package requires `a3gz/chubby-assets` and `a3gz/sunra-dom-parser`. These however are, as Chubby itself, are still in development stage. As such, I can't include the dependency requirements in Chubby's `composer.json` yet.   
For the moment, both dependencies must be solved in the application's `composer.json`.*
