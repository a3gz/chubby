# Chubby
Adding some fat to [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim).

For more information, please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/a3gz/chubby/wiki).

## Install via Composer 

Go to the directory where you want the new application to sit, then create the project: 

    composer create-project a3gz/chubby -s dev


This will create a project called `chubby`. 
Chubby needs all required dependencies to sit on the `src` directory:

    > cd chubby/src
    > composer install

Finally go to your browser and request: 

    .../chubby/src/public/hello/world


It is very unlikely that you'll want your application to be called `chubby`, so you may want to rename that directory.
